# Operator basis

New physics contributions are always defined as contributions to dimension-6
operators in an effective field theory (EFT) below the $W$ mass in the
$\overline{\text{MS}}$ renormalization scheme with naive dimensional regularization.

flavio follows the conventions of the [Wilson coefficient exchange format (WCxf)](https://wcxf.github.io) that facilitates the exchange of Wilson coefficient values between different codes. New physics contributions in flavio have to be specified in the `flavio` Wilson coefficient basis for the weak effective theory (WET). The full list of operators can be found in this PDF file:
