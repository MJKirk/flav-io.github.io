## Some general notes on conventions

- Unless noted explicitly, branching ratios and angular observables always
imply a *CP-average*. For instance, charged $B$ decay modes are always written as
$B^+ \to \ldots$, but what is meant is the average of the $B^+$ and the $B^-$
decay.
- For lepton flavour violating $B$ decays, no CP-average is made; e.g. the
decay $B^-\to e^+\mu^-$ (`B+->emu`, *sic*) is distinct from
$B^-\to\mu^+e^-$ (`B+->mue`) but its rate is equal to $B^+\to \mu^+e^-$
by CPT.
- *"Binned branching ratio"* refers to the $q^2$-integral of the differential branching
ratio, which is a dimensionless number and which coincides with the total branching
ratio if the bin spans the whole kinematic domain. *"Binned differential branching ratio"*
refers instead to the binned branching ratio divided by the bin width, which
has units of GeV$^{-2}$. This definition is frequently used by LHCb and has the
advantage that it is easier  to  compare results in the same kinematic region
but with different bin sizes.
- The conventions for $B\to V\ell^+\ell^-$ angular observables follow the ones
used by LHCb, which differ from the ones used in many theory papers,
e.g. for $A_\text{FB}$, $S_4$, $P_4^\prime$, $A_7$, $A_9$
(see e.g. [arXiv:1506.03970](http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1506.03970)).
- Lepton flavour $\ell$ always refers to an average of electron and muon modes.
