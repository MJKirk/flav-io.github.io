# Observables / Meson-antimeson mixing /  $B^0$-$\bar B^0$ mixing



The tables below have been generated automatically from the observables currently
implemented in flavio. The first column is the string name that must  be used
when calling functions such as `flavio.sm_prediction`. The last column lists
the arguments the observable depends on (which can also be empty in case of
a scalar observable).

| Name | Symbol | Description | Arguments |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `DeltaGamma_d` | $\Delta\Gamma_d$ | Decay width difference in the $B^0$-$\bar B^0$ system |  |
| `DeltaM_d` | $\Delta M_d$ | Mass difference in the $B^0$-$\bar B^0$ system |  |
| `S_psiK` | $S_{\psi K_S}$ | Mixing induced CP asymmetry in $B^0\to J/\psi K_S$ |  |
| `a_fs_d` | $a_\text{fs}^d$ | CP asymmetry in flavour-specific $B^0$ decays |  |
