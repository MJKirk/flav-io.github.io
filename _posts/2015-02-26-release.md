This is the first public release of flavio.

<!-- more -->

So far, the following processes have been implemented:

- Observables in $B^0$, $B_s$, and $K^0$ mixing
- $B\to K^{(*)}\ell^+\ell^-$ with  $\ell=e$,  $\mu$, or $\tau$, including all
angular observables
- $B\to K^*\gamma$
- $B\to K^{*}\ell_1^+\ell_2^-$ lepton flavour violating decays
- $B\to (D, D^*, \pi, \rho) \ell\nu$ with  $\ell=e$,  $\mu$, or $\tau$

The initial feature set includes

- Computing Standard Model predictions and uncertainties
- New physics predictions for arbitrary values of Wilson coefficients

The release is also available via [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/), so
you can install it using `pip` ([detailed instructions](/docs/installation.html)).

The code makes extensive use of unit tests and predictions have been thoroughly
compared both to the literature and to an existing Mathematica code that has
been used for numerous publications. Nevertheless, the code is still in beta
phase, so care should be taken when using it for publications.
